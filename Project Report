*Project Report Draft*

Introduction: 
What are the requirements of the project? What are the responsibilities and contributions of each groupmate? 

Problem analysis and identification of algorithms: 
Specify the requirements of related subtasks, and identify efficient algorithms available to meet the requirements.  

Solution design: 
Dividing the project into manageable subtasks as functional units. 
Specify I/Oâ€™s for functional unit. Arithmetic ways to carry out the O from the I of each unit. 
The design of integrated software solution that assembles functional units (a flowchart is suggested.)  

Implementation: Specify software development environment and tools. Specify the contributions of each groupmate in the implementation. Code segments are not required. 
I will check the entire program anyway. 

Testing: Unit and integration tests with I/O samples. Bugs or problem identified in testing and corrections made if any. It is strongly suggested to include the steps of your 
integration test with the I/O (screenshots can be helpful). I may reference the steps to 
verify your program. 

Summary: Summarize your learning outcomes through completing this project.
